# About test cases
**-t1.txt** file consisting of test cases which handle basic operations of the binary tree, this text case file gives importance on reflecting the appropriate working of all the basic operations in binary tree.
**-t2.txt** file consisting of test cases which handle edge cases and reflecting the importance on how the mutex locks handle to prevent writing into the buffer when another read-thread is printing the tree.
**-t3.txt** file consisting of test cases to reflect the usage of read-write locks.
